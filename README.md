## Trade State

`traderData: str:`

traderData should be a string (str). This might contain some textual data related to a trader, such as a username or identifier.
timestamp: Time:

`timestamp` should be an instance of a Time class or type. This isn't a built-in Python type, so it's likely defined elsewhere in your application or a third-party library you are using. It represents a specific point in time.
listings: Dict[Symbol, Listing]:

`listings` should be a dictionary (Dict) where each key is of type Symbol and each value is of type Listing. Both Symbol and Listing would be types or classes defined elsewhere. This structure suggests it's used to map trading symbols to their respective listings.


`order_depths: Dict[Symbol, OrderDepth]:`

Similar to listings, order_depths is a dictionary where each key is a Symbol and each value an OrderDepth. This dictionary presumably stores information about the depth of the order book for different symbols.


`own_trades: Dict[Symbol, List[Trade]]:`

own_trades is a dictionary mapping a Symbol to a list of Trade objects. This is used to track the trades executed by the trader themselves for each symbol.


`market_trades: Dict[Symbol, List[Trade]]:`

market_trades functions similarly to own_trades but for trades present in the market data rather than those executed by the trader.


`position: Dict[Product, Position]:`

position is a dictionary mapping a Product (likely another custom type) to a Position object. This indicates the current holding position in various products.


`observations: Observation:`

observations is expected to be an instance of the Observation class. This might hold data or metrics observed over some period or event.
